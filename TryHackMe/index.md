# TryHackMe Room writeups

I'll write down some of the rooms I've completed, but don't expect a full list, cause right now, I've already completed 117 rooms.

If you miss a room and want me to add it here, dont hesitate to contact me via [twitter](https://twitter.com/_the_someone) or the TryHackMe-Discord.
