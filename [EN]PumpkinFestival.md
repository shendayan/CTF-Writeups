## Finding out the IP address

In the third part, the IP is also displayed when the VM is started.

Now my target is 192.168.178.61!

## Portscan

Also this time I start with a port scan - but now with nmap! :)

`nmap -A 192.168.178.61` tells me that there are two open ports.
````
PORT      STATE    SERVICE      VERSION
21/tcp    open     ftp          vsftpd 2.0.8 or later
| ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230)
|_drwxr-xr-x    2 0        0            4096 Jul 12  2019 secret
80/tcp    open     http         Apache httpd 2.4.7 ((Ubuntu))
|_http-generator: WordPress 4.9.3
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: Pumpkin Festival &#8211; PumpkinToken : 06c3eb12ef2389e2752335...
````

That starts off well, an FTP server with a directory called "secret" and a web server with some sort of token and a hash.

## FTP-Server

This time I started with the ftp-server. Let's see what's in the "secret" directory.

Here I navigated to the first token with the commands `cd secret`,` ls` and `get token.txt`.

![Image](https://github.com/shendayan/CTF-ressources/blob/master/PumpkinFestival-Screenshot-22.png)

`PumpkinToken : 2d6dbbae84d724409606eddd9dd71265 `

## Webserver

So now it's time for the web server:

![Image](https://github.com/shendayan/CTF-ressources/blob/master/PumpkinFestival-Screenshot-14.png)

Thank you for growing pumpkins, Jack. Help from Harry? Who is Harry now?

Okay, PumpkinTokens obviously help me get in. This will be interesting.

Alohomora ... I've heard that before, but I don't know exactly where.

A quick look at Google tells me that I must have read it in a Harry Potter book years ago.

It's a spell that is supposed to open doors. Could be a password.

So it's clear which Harry helped here :)

When I wanted to look at the source, I noticed that the right-click was blocked here.

Okay, then just put a `view-source:` in front of the actual address and it works anyway.

The source code contains the request to Harry to find the pumpkins.

Tricky! The second token is written on the site in the background color.

![Image](https://github.com/shendayan/CTF-ressources/blob/master/PumpkinFestival-Screenshot-5.png)

`PumpkinToken : 45d9ee7239bc6b0bb21d3f8e1c5faa52`

## dirb

Let's see if there is anything else interesting to discover on the web server.

`dirb http://192.168.178.61`

There are a few objects that I would like to take a closer look at.

````
+ http://192.168.178.61/robots.txt (CODE:200|SIZE:102)
==> DIRECTORY: http://192.168.178.61/store/
==> DIRECTORY: http://192.168.178.61/users/
````

First I take a look at the robots.txt:
````
User-agent: * 
Disallow: /wordpress/
Disallow: /tokens/
Disallow: /users/
Disallow: /store/track.txt
````
/wordpress/ results in a 404 error.

/tokens/ results at least in a 403 - Forbidden Error.

/users/ too.

I can look at /store/track.txt:

````
Hey Jack!

Thanks for choosing our local store. Hope you like the services.
Tracking code : 2542 8231 6783 486

-Regards 
admin@pumpkins.local
````

What exactly I can do with the tracking code is not yet clear to me.

But first make a note of this, who knows what it can be good for.

Anyway, the sender tells me to put pumpkins.local in my `/etc/hosts` file.

This may also be a new username.

`nano /etc/hosts` and enter the following under the loopback address (127.0.0.1):

`192.168.178.61 pumpkins.local`

I then entered pumpkins.local in the browser:

![Image](https://github.com/shendayan/CTF-ressources/blob/master/PumpkinFestival-Screenshot-7.png)

At the bottom of the page is the third token:

`PumpkinToken : 06c3eb12ef2389e2752335beccfb2080`

Scrolling a little deeper you will find the note which determines the next step:

## Proudly powered by WordPress

Accordingly, I run wpscan next:

`wpscan -e u --url http://pumpkins.local`

Here, interesting facts are brought to light, too:

````
[+] WordPress readme found: http://pumpkins.local/readme.html
[+] Upload directory has listing enabled: http://pumpkins.local/wp-content/uploads/
[i] User(s) Identified:
[+] admin
[+] morse
````

Okay, let's start from top to bottom - Wordpress Readme:

![Image](https://github.com/shendayan/CTF-ressources/blob/master/PumpkinFestival-Screenshot-17.png)

That's interesting :)

K82v0SuvV1En350M0uxiXVRTmBrQIJQN78s is neither base64, base32 nor one of the hashes that `hash identifier` knows.

That makes me curious. I can hardly imagine that gibberish was simply written on the page.

At [Cyber-Chef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) you can test various types of encryption.

After what felt like an eternity of manual tests, I finally found what I was looking for -> base62 :)

`K82v0SuvV1En350M0uxiXVRTmBrQIJQN78s:morse & jack : Ug0t!TrIpyJ`

Looks like I found two pairs of login details there.

Now I'm going to take a look at the rest of the Wordpress pages before looking for a way to use the login data.

#6(no title) gives a nice hint:

![Image](https://github.com/shendayan/CTF-ressources/blob/master/PumpkinFestival-Screenshot-8.png)

So I need all PumpkinTokens to be able to generate the ticket.

It would be good to know now how many "all" are ...

The remaining pages were all uninteresting templates. You can log in via the blog site.

morse : Ug0t!TrIpyJ works!

Unfortunately morse is not an admin, but as we learned in the last part of the series, he is only the supplier for pumpkin seeds.

When I had looked through almost all of the pages, my eyes fell on the profile.

The fourth token is hidden under `Biographical Info`:

![Image](https://github.com/shendayan/CTF-ressources/blob/master/PumpkinFestival-Screenshot-23.png)

`PumpkinToken : 7139e925fd43618653e51f820bc6201b`

I haven't found anything else here, so -> Log out!

Jack : Ug0t!TrIpyJ does not work! Then I have to try the admin.

But unfortunately I don't have a password for admin ...

After a while and many unsuccessful attempts, I reread my notes and concluded that "Alohomora!" now would be the right spell for my situation.

In fact it works!

admin : Alohomora! really opens a door for me here.

Let's see what can be found now.

In any case, there is a draft for a posting that I had already recognized with morse, but which I couldn't look at.

There is not much in it. But it doesn't have to, the content is enough for me:

![Image](https://github.com/shendayan/CTF-ressources/blob/master/PumpkinFestival-Screenshot-1.png)

`PumpkinToken : f2e00edc353309b40e1aed18e18ab2c4`

Token Number 5!

But nothing more was to be found here. Somehow I got stuck.

## If there is no progress, you may have missed something ...

To avoid this error, I started nmap again and this time checked all ports.
At the same time, dirbuster ran with an extremely large wordlist and recursive search.
And so that I don't miss anything, I let go of hydra on the FTP server to search for access for users jack, morse and harry:

`nmap -sC -sV -A -p- 192.168.178.61`

Dirbuster ran as a GUI because dirb has problems with such large wordlists.

`hydra -e nsr -L users.txt -P /root/Wordlists/rockyou.txt`

Definitely time to take a short (to medium) coffee break.

Back on the computer, I was presented with results that I had not expected:

Dirbuster found another file in the /tokens/ directory on the server http://192.168.178.61:

![Image](https://github.com/shendayan/CTF-ressources/blob/master/PumpkinFestival-Screenshot-2.png)

`PumpkinToken : 2c0e11d2200e2604587c331f02a7ebea`

Token Number 6!

hydra actually gave me new creds for the FTP server.

![Image](https://github.com/shendayan/CTF-ressources/blob/master/PumpkinFestival-Screenshot-9.png)

`harry:yrrah` 

## FTP second try

Logged in with the new creds, the next token is right in front of my nose.

`get token.txt` and` cat token.txt` show me the content of token number 7:

`PumpkinToken : ba9fa9abf2be9373b7cbd9a6457f374e`

After I opened the folders `Donotopen`,` NO`, `NOO`,` NOOO` and `NOOOO`, the next token was there:

![Image](https://github.com/shendayan/CTF-ressources/blob/master/PumpkinFestival-Screenshot-4.png)

`PumpkinToken : f9c5053d01e0dfc30066476ab0f0564c`

Now there are already 8 tokens.

Well, someone probably enjoyed creating a "No" folder structure. So dig deeper:

`cd NOOOOO`, `cd NOOOOOO` & `get data.txt`

`cat data.txt` shows a lot of clutter. So it is not a "real" text file.

With binwalk you can find out what is really hidden inside the file:

````
binwalk data.txt
DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0             0x0             POSIX tar archive
````

I unpack the archive with `tar -xf data.txt`.

I examine the resulting file `data` again with binwalk, since it is also not readable for `cat`:

````
binwalk data
DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0             0x0             bzip2 compressed data, block size = 900k
````

Anyone who creates such folder structures as on the FTP server also packs archives into archives :)

````
bunzip2 data
bunzip2: Can't guess original name for data -- using data.out

binwalk data.out 

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0             0x0             POSIX tar archive

tar -xf data.out
tar: Ein einzelner Nullblock bei 25

binwalk key 

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0             0x0             POSIX tar archive

tar -xf key
tar: Ein einzelner Nullblock bei 22
````
The resulting file "jack" is again a text file. However, one that is written in hex format.

When I pipe this file to hex2raw, I feel like it is not complete.

So I entered it again into an [Online Hex-Decoder](https://cryptii.com/pipes/hex-decoder) and it now seems to be complete:

-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
````

An SSH private key. The file name suggests that it's user is "jack".

## SSH

nmap had provided me with the appropriate port for SSH in the meantime:

`6880/tcp open   ssh                OpenSSH 6.6.1p1 Ubuntu 2ubuntu2.13 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)`

So I'll try a connection with the key and User Jack:

![Image](https://github.com/shendayan/CTF-ressources/blob/master/PumpkinFestival-Screenshot-11.png)

Okay, a "private key" that everyone can read is really not that private.
I didn't know that because of this you couldn't connect to it via SSH. Learned something again.

`chmod 600 jack.txt` should solve the problem.

Bingo!

The file `token` cannot be read. With `file token` I can see what kind of file it is.

So it's an executable file. With `./token` I execute it and get token number 9 displayed:

````

Not bad, that was a very well hidden token number 10!

Since I got Jack's password from the page http://pumpkins.local/readme.html, I tried `sudo -l`. Maybe he can do something as root.

Neither the directory nor the file existed at this point in time, so I have a free hand what I create there.

Due to the advanced time and the smell of a root shell in the air, I was quite uncreative here:

````
jack@pumpkin:~$ mkdir pumpkins
jack@pumpkin:~$ cd pumpkins/
jack@pumpkin:~/pumpkins$ nano alohomora
jack@pumpkin:~/pumpkins$ cat alohomora 
#!/bin/sh
echo "Alohomora!"
su -
jack@pumpkin:~/pumpkins$ chmod +x alohomora
jack@pumpkin:~/pumpkins$ sudo ./alohomora 
Alohomora!
root@pumpkin:~# 
````

## Root-Shell :)

Securing the ticket was a pice of cake now.

I find it interesting that in the end I didn't need one of the tokens. But very satisfying that I found them all!

I really liked the series and it was tricky in some places!
Can be recommended without restriction! :)

Thanks for reading and happy pwning!
